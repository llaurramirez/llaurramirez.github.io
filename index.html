  <p>Dear Pinterest Team,</p>

  <p>
    I’m thrilled to apply for the <strong>Product Management Apprenticeship</strong> at Pinterest. As an experienced internal auditor who built and deployed a generative AI solution to automate reporting at Chewy, I bring a unique combination of analytical rigor, process optimization, and cross-functional collaboration—paired with a growing passion for product development and user-centered innovation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the past four years, I’ve helped guide business and technology teams through system implementations, risk analysis, and control design—essentially translating complex operational needs into structured, scalable solutions. Most notably, I led the creation of an AI-driven audit tool that reduced reporting time by 80%. This experience ignited my love for building tools that solve real problems and inspired my pivot toward product management.
  </p>

  <p>
    While I don’t come from a traditional tech background, I’ve self-taught product fundamentals, experimented with Amazon Q Apps and Tableau dashboards, and embraced data as a cornerstone of insight-driven decision making. My day-to-day already mirrors the role of a PM: scoping challenges, aligning stakeholders, identifying patterns in data, and advocating for continuous improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to join a mission-driven team that empowers creativity and inspiration at a global scale. I admire Pinterest’s commitment to inclusive innovation, and I’m eager to grow under the mentorship of seasoned PMs, contribute to meaningful projects, and learn how to craft delightful, data-informed user experiences.
  </p>

  <p>Thank you for considering my application. I would love the opportunity to bring my operational insight, curiosity, and drive to Pinterest, and I look forward to potentially joining the team.</p>

  <p class="signature">Warmly,<br/>Lauren Ramirez</p>
